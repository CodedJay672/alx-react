# React immutable project
Immutability allows us to create pure function. This means, when applied with the same set of input data, we get the same output every single time. While designed to bring these powerful functional concepts to JavaScript, it presents an Object-Oriented API familiar to Javascript engineers and closely mirroring that of Array, Map, and Set. It is easy and efficient to convert to and from plain Javascript types.

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, we will have achieved the following:
1. In this project, we learn what they are, and why we should use them.
2. How to use the Immutable.js library to bring immutability to Javascript
3. The differences between List and Map
4. How to use Merge, Concat, and Deep Merging
5. What a lazy Seq is
