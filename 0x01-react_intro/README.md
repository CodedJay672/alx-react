# 0x01-React_Intro
This directory contains code from the ALX_react project for the short specialization software engineering program. React is a javascript library and makes use of JSX which allows us to write javascript and HTML which can be rendered by using the  ReactDOM.render() function.

## Project Objectives
At the end of this project we should be able to perform the following functions:
1. How to create a basic Javascript application using React  
2. How to use the package create-react-app to start developing quickly with React  
3. What JSX is and how to use it  
4. How to use the React Developer Tools to debug your code
5. How to use Enzymeâ€™s Shadow rendering to test your application  
6. How to use React with Webpack & Babel  

## Project methodology
This project creates a simple react app named dashboard using the create-react-app. This application will implement a custom getFullYear() function which will allows us access the current year, as well as a a getFooterCopy() function which takes in one boolean argument. The function will return Holberton school when argument is true and Holberton school main dashboard when false.  
we will also create a notification element which imports React and exports a function which will return a div which will contain a paragraph. This notification element will be styled using the notification css style.
