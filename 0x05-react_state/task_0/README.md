# React state
Props are read only properties that we pass on to components when we initialize them. These props are accessed by passing the props into the constructor and into the super keyword before writing any other codes in the constructore. React state on the other hand are the editable data that we pass into the components which allow the elements come alive.

## Project requirement
in this project, we are allowed to use only Vi, Vim, VSCode and emacs editors. This project needs a README file which describes the project and telling the logic used to solve the tasks. Comments are hightly recommended to aid understanding by the author and other devlopers who will access the codes.
