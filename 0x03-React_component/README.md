# ALx React Component
In this project we focus on working with classes and properties. Components are the building blocks of React applications. Huge websites can be broken down into several components which can be reused in different pages no matter how many times they are called.

## Project Objectives
At the end of this project, we should be able to know the following
1. When to use a Class or a function to create a component
2. The lifecycle of a Class component
3. How to test a component
4. How to utilize a Jest spy to verify that a function is being called correctly
5. What an HOC is and how to use it
6. How to optimize performance and control which components to render

## project requirements
In this project we will be working with the last task from the previous project 0x02-React_props.
