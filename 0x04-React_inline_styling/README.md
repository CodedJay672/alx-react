# React Inline Styling
React components can be styled using inline css definitions just like regular HTML files. In this project we will be using the aphrodite library which allows us to inject inline css styles into our react applicatiion. These styles allow us to do whatever we can do with the normal css definition from an external css file, including animations, media query, and lots more.

## Objective of this project
At the end of the project, we would have understood the following concepts:
1. the differences between using a CSS file and inline styling
2. how to use a CSS-in-JS tool like Aphrodite
3. how to use conditions within JS to apply different styles
4. how to use responsive design and make the application show a different UI according to the screen size
5. how to create small animations within the app

## Project requirement
In this project, we will be required to copy over the task_5 file from the 0x04-React_component project which should be fully completed by now. This project should have a readme file at the root of the project directory and should be pushed to github, otherwise the checker will not check the files in the repo.
also we are only allowed to use editors like Vim, emacs, VSCode to write and push the codes. The files should end will a new line and should be commented to boost understanding for other programers or help to understand the code logic when we come back to the code in futer time.
